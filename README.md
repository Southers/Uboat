# Uboat Scripting Samples

There are 3 things done in it:

1. Spawning new UI in the main scene (fps counter).

2. Directing all torpedoes back at the player's ship using Harmony.

3. Adding 2 new console commands: HelloWorld and Gravity. The second one changes gravity and needs to be followed by a numeric value.
